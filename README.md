# Hearty
## Project background

  With cardio vascular diseases being such an issue in today’s world, this project aims to use 
data and state-of-the-art predictive models to help patients understand if they are at risk 
and to overall reduce CAD-related deaths around the world. To be clear, the aim of this 
project is not to diagnose someone from CAD; rather, we would like our product to be the 
“first step” for people to be aware of their heart condition whether they have a chance of 
CAD or not. Therefore, this product is aimed towards the general public who would like to 
know about their health condition. By implementing this project, we hope that our product 
will help reduce the mortality rate of coronary artery disease. 

  Although our product is fairly simple, our product has several functionalities and features 
that we believe will help achieve our main objective. The first good aspect of our product is 
it is aesthetically pleasing, interactive and user friendly. With the simple yet straightforward 
buttons and information shown, users will easily run through our product without any 
problems. The main functionality is the prediction process where first, the user can click a 
button that directs them to a form that needs to be filled. These values will then be used to 
predict CAD. The convenience that the form provides is that incorrect type of input will not 
be accepted and tooltips/pop-ups will be shown if a user is unsure about a specific feature. 
Therefore, users are assured that the product will run smoothly and correctly. Lastly, our 
product does not only give a statement on how likely you are to have a CAD but will also 
provide information on CAD such that users can know how to prevent it and what to do if 
they are likely to have CAD
